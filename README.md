> A FeathersJS application

Exposes a set of endpoints/services that are consumable as a conventional REST API or via WebSockets.

Services are described as Mongoose models and initialzed using featherjs' Mongoose connector. As such, these services are composed as functions which can then be hooked up/configured to the app instance.
